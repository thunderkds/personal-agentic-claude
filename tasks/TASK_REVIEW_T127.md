# TASK_REVIEW — T127: Terse but verbatim — replies and sub-agent reports keep code, errors and paths exact; review catches over-engineering

> Sibling of `tasks/TASK_GUIDE_T127.md`. Everything here is **filled by the reviewer at Stage
> 4/5** — it is deliberately NOT in the guide, because the implementing agent re-reads the guide on
> every turn and never fills these two sections.
>
> Consumers resolve each section **guide first, this file second** (`.claude/hooks/lib/guide_sections.py`):
> a legacy guide that still carries these sections inline keeps working unchanged, and a stray
> review file can never override an inline section.

## Evidence

| Check | Result | Notes / output snippet |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **New test(s) cover Acceptance Criteria (file paths pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [test file path(s) — required before Done] |
| Verification command run | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [paste actual output] |
| Negative cases hold | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| verify | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [what was observed — must literally state "pass" or "fail" here too, e.g. "skill run, feature confirmed working — pass": the merge gate scans this Notes column for the word "pass", not just the Result column] |
| Review scope bounded to the change's blast radius (affected set, not whole repo) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [what was reviewed vs. skipped, and why] |
| Full smoke suite still green (no regression) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| **UI: Visual regression (diff or verdict pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [screenshot path or LLM verdict — required for UI tasks, Hard-Stop Gate 6] |
| **UI: Design-system compliance (tokens/colors/typography verified)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [method used + output] |
| **UI: Responsiveness at target viewports** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [viewports tested, any overflow findings] |

## Demonstration

> Anchors what this task delivered to an observable before/after pair. BEFORE has no `N/A` path:
> if the task changes executable code, BEFORE is a pasted, timestamped terminal capture taken
> **before any implementation commit exists**; if it does not (docs, templates, skill-instruction
> text), BEFORE is the **verbatim prior content** of what changed — a quoted excerpt, not a command.

**BEFORE** (non-executable change; verbatim prior content, captured 2026-09-25 before any implementation commit, from `CLAUDE.md:25-33`, identical in `agents/general-agent-template.md`, and `skills/code-review/SKILL.md:57-63`):

```
### Response Standard

- Lead with the answer or verdict; method and caveats come after.
- Asking for a decision: recommendation first, alternatives one line each.
- Cut sentences restating the question or narrating what you read.
- A table only to compare on 3+ dimensions, never to lay out one thing.
- Say what is blocked and what you need, not all you could do.
- Don't re-list open items your last reply listed; point back in a line.
```

#### Conditional reviewers (activate based on diff content)
| Persona | Activate when diff contains… |
|---|---|
| **security-reviewer** | Auth logic, input handling, secrets, permissions, SQL/shell |
| **performance-reviewer** | DB queries, loops over large collections, cache logic, network calls |
| **migration-reviewer** | Schema changes, data migrations, seed files |
| **adversarial-reviewer** | ≥ 50 changed lines, or any security-reviewer activation |
| **api-reviewer** | Public API changes, endpoint signatures, OpenAPI/schema files |
```

`docs/claude-md/token-economy.md` and `tests/test_token_economy_docs.py`: absent.

**AFTER**: [same command, post-change] OR [verbatim excerpt of the new content]

**DELTA**: [one sentence — what a user can now do that they could not before]

**WITNESS**: [who ran it and when — derived from `memory/event-trace/Txxx.jsonl`, never the
implementing agent alone]
