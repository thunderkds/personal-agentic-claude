# TASK_REVIEW — T226: Stage 1 offers the optional companion MCP servers

> Sibling of `tasks/TASK_GUIDE_T226.md`. Everything here is **filled by the reviewer at Stage
> 4/5** — it is deliberately NOT in the guide, because the implementing agent re-reads the guide on
> every turn and never fills these two sections.
>
> Consumers resolve each section **guide first, this file second** (`.claude/hooks/lib/guide_sections.py`):
> a legacy guide that still carries these sections inline keeps working unchanged, and a stray
> review file can never override an inline section.

## Auto decisions

Mode: auto
1. New Stage 1 skill `companion-setup` driven by a data file; on a pick it shows the install link and missing tools, and the kit never installs; `setup.sh` gets one log line, no menu — DEBATED: Stage 1 skill, link only, plus one log line (Advocate 1: Stage 1 prompt-only skill `companion-setup`, `setup.sh` unchanged; Advocate 2: skill `companions` with a data file, plus one `log_info` line in `setup.sh`) ⚠ decided for you — please review
2. List easy-ui and easy-verifier as choices; easy-memory and easy-personal as "needs repo access" unless installed; leave out easy-context — DEBATED: two public choices, private ones not choices (Advocate 1: offer easy-ui, easy-verifier and easy-context, private ones a neutral skipped line; Advocate 2: offer easy-ui and easy-verifier, leave out easy-context, never attempt an install) ⚠ decided for you — please review
3. Implementation runs on the CLI and model of this session — RULE: `docs/claude-md/tracks.md` `### Every user stop and its auto rule`
Checks: pending
Memory: pending
Not done: merge (yours); auto verify: running (T182)
Paused: auto-mode check failed — no test run in memory/event-trace/T226.jsonl — write /home/hungnguyenhuu/workspace/pets/personal-agentic-claude/.claude/hooks/.state/active_task.d/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID with the task ID (minimal-track step 1): `mkdir -p /home/hungnguyenhuu/workspace/pets/personal-agentic-claude/.claude/hooks/.state/active_task.d && printf '%s\n%s\n' "T226" "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" > /home/hungnguyenhuu/workspace/pets/personal-agentic-claude/.claude/hooks/.state/active_task.d/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, then rerun the task's tests so the trace records them under the task, then stop; extended track, but the trace has no `code-review` Skill call (Stage 4 runs in auto mode); Risk Medium, but the trace has no `security-review` Skill call [report a11e3457f371]

## Evidence

| Check | Result | Notes / output snippet |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **New test(s) cover Acceptance Criteria (file paths pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [test file path(s) — required before Done] |
| Verification command run | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [paste actual output] |
| Negative cases hold | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| verify | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [what was observed — must literally state "pass" or "fail" here too, e.g. "skill run, feature confirmed working — pass": the merge gate scans this Notes column for the word "pass", not just the Result column] |
| Review scope bounded to the change's blast radius (affected set, not whole repo) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [what was reviewed vs. skipped, and why] |
| Full smoke suite still green (no regression) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| **Companion score (easy-verifier)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [`overall` and `change_risk` as the tool returned them, the scope, the ref, and the absolute path of the verifier report after a literal `report:` label — e.g. "overall 86 (>= 80), change_risk pass, scope changes, ref `main...HEAD`, report: `/home/me/.easy-verifier-reports/kit/score_changes_20261028T0530Z.html`". The gate reads the path that follows `report:` and nothing else, so with no label, or a path that is absent, the row is unscored — write ☑ N/A instead. ☑ N/A with a reason when neither companion tool was run: the merge gate blocks on ☑ fail only, never on an absent or N/A row] |
| **UI: Visual regression (diff or verdict pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [screenshot path or LLM verdict — required for UI tasks, Hard-Stop Gate 6] |
| **UI: Design-system compliance (tokens/colors/typography verified)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [method used + output] |
| **UI: Responsiveness at target viewports** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [viewports tested, any overflow findings] |

## Demonstration

> Anchors what this task delivered to an observable before/after pair. BEFORE has no `N/A` path:
> if the task changes executable code, BEFORE is a pasted, timestamped terminal capture taken
> **before any implementation commit exists**; if it does not (docs, templates, skill-instruction
> text), BEFORE is the **verbatim prior content** of what changed — a quoted excerpt, not a command.

**BEFORE**: captured before any implementation commit.

```
2026-11-01T05:01:06Z
$ python3 skills/companion-setup/scripts/check_companions.py
python3: can't open file '/home/hungnguyenhuu/workspace/pets/wt-t226/skills/companion-setup/scripts/check_companions.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
exit=2
$ grep -n -i companion setup.sh
exit=1
```

**AFTER**: [same command, post-change] OR [verbatim excerpt of the new content]

**DELTA**: [one sentence — what a user can now do that they could not before]

**WITNESS**: [who ran it and when — derived from `memory/event-trace/Txxx.jsonl`, never the
implementing agent alone]
